            I started my career in 2003 as a call centre executive and worked
            in the industry for 4.5 years and then moved to journalism. I used
            to cover feature stories that included interviewing celebrities,
            writing stories on health, fitness, wellness, crime, music and so on.
            I also have one year experience in digital marketing.

            creative writing and also cook good food.
